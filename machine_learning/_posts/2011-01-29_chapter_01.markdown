Choosing a target function
----
The knowledge we want to learn is the best legal move.  We can best represent this as a function or program.  One common strategy is to reduce improving performance P at task T to the problem of learning a *target function*.

Let's try using this as our terget function:
ChooseMove: B -> M

def choose_move(board_state)
	return best_move

An alternative to ChooseMove would a function that scores a given board state:
V: B -> R

def v(board_state)
	return score
